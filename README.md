Our team will be studying loans in India and their default rates based on customer characteristics. Our primary research questions are as follows:

•	Do customers who default on loans have statistically lower incomes than those who don't default?
•	Does homeownership correlate with lower rates of default?
•	Does being married decrease the likelihood of default?
•	Does an additional year of homeownership reduce the likelihood of default?
•	Does job experience or age show a larger impact on someone defaulting on their loan?

We recognize that not all of these questions can be answered with EDA including Z-Tests/T-Tests and Chi- Squares, but are choosing to pose these questions now for consideration when we eventually develop a model based on this dataset.

Our dataset is from Kaggle and can be found here and we will be using the "Training Data" dataset, which has around 252K data points.
